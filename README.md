# Word-Frequency-Visualizer
Here's a sample `README.md` for a **Word Frequency Visualizer** project. This assumes the tool analyzes a text (or multiple texts), computes word frequencies, and visualizes the results (e.g. with a bar chart, word cloud, etc.).

You can modify the sections as needed based on your specific implementation.

# 📊 Word Frequency Visualizer

A simple and interactive tool to analyze and visualize word frequencies from text input. Supports text files, copy-paste input, and real-time visualizations like bar charts and word clouds.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Upload text files or paste raw text
* ✅ Clean and tokenize text data
* ✅ Filter out stop words and punctuation
* ✅ View frequency results as:

  * Bar Chart
  * Word Cloud
* ✅ Export results to CSV or PNG
* ✅ Case-insensitive and customizable stopword list

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash

├── app.py                 # Main application (Flask / Streamlit / etc.)
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── templates/             # HTML templates (if using Flask)

```

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-frequency-visualizer.git
   cd word-frequency-visualizer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

### Option 1: Run with Streamlit

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: Run with Flask

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` (or Streamlit's local link).

## 📊 Visualization Examples

* **Bar Chart**: Top 20 most frequent words
* **Word Cloud**: Size-weighted layout for quick insight

## 🔧 Configuration

You can customize:

* Stopword list (in `stopwords.txt`)
* Number of top words to display
* Case sensitivity
* Minimum word length

## 📦 Dependencies

Common packages used:

* `matplotlib`
* `wordcloud`
* `nltk`
* `pandas`
* `streamlit` or `flask`

(See `requirements.txt` for full list)

## 📁 Sample Input

Paste text or upload `.txt` files. Example:

```
This is a simple test. This test is only a test.
```

## 📤 Output

* Bar chart of word frequencies
* Word cloud image
* CSV file with words and counts
